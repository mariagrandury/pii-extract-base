# Adding PII tasks

To add new processing tasks, there are three steps required:

 1. [Implement the task] as one of the three modalities of task implementation
 2. Create [task descriptors] for the implemented tasks
 3. [Publish] the task, making it available to the framework


[Implement the task]: task-implementation.md
[task descriptors]: task-descriptor.md
[Publish]: task-collection.md
